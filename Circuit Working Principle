ðŸ“œ Circuit Working Principle

This circuit is a 3-stage transistor-based sequential LED driver, functioning similarly to an asynchronous (ripple) counter or LED chaser, 
but built entirely with discrete components â€” transistors, capacitors, and resistors â€” without any ICs.

ðŸ”¹ How It Works

1. Power Supply

- The circuit operates from a 5V DC source (USB power).

2. Astable Multivibrator Action

- Each stage consists of:

  - NPN transistor (BC547)

  - Capacitor

  - Base bias resistor

- The capacitors between the stages provide a time delay by controlling how quickly the next transistor turns on.

- When a transistor turns on, it connects its LED(s) to ground, lighting them.

3. Sequential Switching

- The first transistor turns on, its capacitor begins charging toward the base of the second transistor.

- Once the capacitor voltage reaches the threshold, the second transistor turns on and the first turns off.

- This process repeats for the third stage and loops back to the first, creating a repeating LED sequence.

4. LED Color Arrangement

- Stage 1 â†’ Blue LED

- Stage 2 â†’ Green LED

- Stage 3 â†’ Two red LEDs (connected in parallel for extra brightness, since each red LED drops ~2V).

The sequence cycles through Blue â†’ Green â†’ Red â†’ Blue...

5. Why No IC?
- This design demonstrates that you can achieve a sequential LED lighting effect purely with discrete components, without relying on 555 timers, CD4017 counters, or microcontrollers.
